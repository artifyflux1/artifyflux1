NASA and other space agencies have already grown lettuce, radishes and mustard greens on the International Space Station. These plants grow in special chambers with LED lights, no soil and carefully controlled temperature and humidity. In 2021, astronauts even ate space grown chili peppers, one of the most complex plants grown off Earth so far. Researchers are now experimenting with lunar and Martian soil simulants to see which crops could survive there. The European Space Agency is testing closed loop systems where plant waste recycles into nutrients for new growth. Scientists are also exploring gene editing to make crops more resistant to radiation and low gravity. The goal is to create self sustaining food systems for future Moon or Mars missions. While challenges remain, like limited water and extreme temperatures, growing food in space is no longer science fiction, it’s happening, and it’s evolving fast. The next harvest might just happen on the Moon.
