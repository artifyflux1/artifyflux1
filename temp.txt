Okay, let's start by breaking down the user's query. They need a visual prompts generator for a video script about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria. The rules are quite strict: each sentence requires four components—sentence number, image generator prompt, image to video prompt, and image to video negative prompt. All must use simple words, no special characters, and each prompt must be a single line.

First, I need to process each sentence one by one. Let's take the first sentence: "Centuries of war and political strife led to the gradual disappearance of the vast collection in Alexandria culminating in catastrophic fires and systematic destruction by conquering armies and ideological zealots." 

For the image generator prompt, I need to vividly describe the scene. Words like "ancient library," "smoke-filled sky," "burning scrolls" come to mind. Make sure to include elements like soldiers, broken pillars, and a chaotic atmosphere. Avoid any numbers or special characters.

Next, the image to video prompt should focus on movement. Mention elements like flickering flames, smoke drifting, soldiers moving, scrolls disintegrating. Keep it simple and within the word limit.

The negative prompt needs to exclude unwanted elements. So list things like explosions, glowing effects, modern structures, etc. No "no" words, just direct exclusions.

Repeat this process for each sentence. Check each prompt for compliance with rules—single line, lowercase, no special characters. Ensure that each prompt accurately reflects the sentence without adding or missing details. Also, maintain consistency in style and simplicity across all prompts. Finally, structure the XML correctly, making sure each sentence's components are grouped properly without any formatting errors.
